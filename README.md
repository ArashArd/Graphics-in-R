# Overview of R graphics

1.  Standard `graphics` in R

-   The `graphics` package, as the , provides a complete set of
    functions for creating a wide variety of plots.

## Grid system:

2.  Trellis & `lattice` graphics

-   Trellis Graphics is a family of techniques for viewing complex,
    multi-variable data sets
-   The techniques were given the name Trellis because: usually results
    are in a .

3.  Grammar of Graphics `ggplot2`

-   A powerful approach, based on the
-   A graphics language, , (points, lines, regions), each with graphical
    “thetics” (color, size, shape).

# Expectation Setting

#### I am assuming the following:

-   You are experienced with R coding - not an expert, but you can hack.
-   You have some statistical knowledge (e.g., what is a histogram or
    Boxplot).

#### This is a quick intro to data visualization with R:

-   I will gloss over a lot of things .
-   More in-depth coverage is available via resources I will mention at
    the end.
-   My goal is to make you excited about graphics in R.

#### Prerequisites

-   To follow along you will need the following:
    -   [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    -   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

# Types of more common use Statistical Graphs

            Types of Data (Variables)

### Numeical Variables

-   Estimation and shape of Distribution
    -   Histogram and Density plots
    -   Box-plot
-   Comparisons
    -   Box-plots & Violin plots
-   Associations and finding the structure between variables
    -   Scatter plots
    -   Time series plots
-   Other Advanced Graphic Tools

### Categorical Variables

-   Count and Percentages

# Data Sets Which I am using here

## Titanic Data set

RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner which sank in the North
Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg. Voyage: from
UK to US.

## `USArrests` Data set

Violent Crime Rates by US State
